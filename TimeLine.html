                        <p>David and Braden got assigned to make a educational game in their video game design class taught by Benjamin Williams.</p>

                        <p>David and Braden sat down to think about what could they teach in a game.  We went over many ideas ranging from chemistry to mining.  We had figured out we could make a game based on any of the skills mentioned in Dungeons and Dragons so we went with Knowledge of Nature.</p>

                        <p>We started out with a dice game that essentialy worked off what you rolled is what you got to do, however it was terrible, it did not give you any choices.</p>

                        <p>David and Braden worked continously on making it a better game.  We added a tech tree, a 2nd dice for rolls, cards, and even population trackers.</p>

                        <p>The game was mostly complete, it lacked any quality artwork and had only a few issues, it still lacked a great deal of strategy but we were to blind to see this at the time.  We presented the project to the class to which we made a great impression on our classmates and teacher.</p>

                        <p>It had been a year since we had really done anything with it since school had gotten in the way.  However, David had all of the content in his house and suggested that he would play a game of it with his friends Matthew and Kaleigh Quick.  They loved the game and asked David why he had not marketed the game yet.  To which he responsed I need art and someone to market it for me.  They jumped on wanting to do the art and marketing.</p>

                        <p>Kaleigh got to work on making the artwork David and Braden had created.  We went from a tech tree which looked like this <img class="timelineImg" src="TechTree.png"> to this <img src="board.png" class="timelineImg">.  We also had hand drawn cards which looked like this <img src="OldCard.png" class="timelineImg"> to this <img src="ABUNDANCE.jpg" class="timelineImg"></p>

                        <p>David had an interview with Canvas for an internship.  He talked about the game and the interviewer asked him if he was going to go to Salt Con to show off Natural Selection.  David did not know about it but he looked into it and got a spot to show off at prototype alley.  So on thursday night the group all showed up with the game and had it played tested and the reviews were great.  We even got some good feedback on how to make the game better.  The major change we made was to add wild cards to give the players more of a choice when playing the game.<br/> <img src="MattAndDavid.jpg" class="timelineImg"><img class="timelineImg" src="ClarkeAndKylie.jpg"></p>

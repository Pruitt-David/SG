                    <p>
                        This was for a video game design class I took with my friend Braden Steiner. We were told we had to make an educational video game and a board game as our final project.  
                        We misunderstood partly and heard that we needed to make an educational board game and an educational video game.  We tossed around many ideas until we decided to make a game like DND, where you could learn something out of it.

                    <p>
                        We started by making a dice game that literally was the worse game ever made.  It was basically I roll then you roll and whoever got higher wins.
                        We started to say we need to add some complexity like Rock, Paper, Scissors.  This basically evolved off of the idea of our love for the game starcraft which was about a balance strategy game of rock, paper, scissors.
                        We started to make the dice mean something and had started work on our game called at the time Evolution

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start by dealing out 3 cards to every player and placing the Abundance Card in the center of the board for the current event.  The players are roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest number goes first.  The player who won draws a card to start their turn.  They may play any cards that they may like to.  However any other player may play a event card from their hand also at any time.  The current player then rolls both dice to see what it to occur on their turn, wether that is combat, drawing an additional card, or leveling up.  After the dice is rolled and the player has done that action the next players turn begins when they draw a card.</p>
